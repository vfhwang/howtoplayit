    <h1>Golf</h1>
<h2>Kit</h2>
<p>Deck of cards</p>
<h2>Players</h2>
<p>2 to 7</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Get the lowest score possible with your four cards</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Golf has 9 rounds. Each player has a square of face-down cards. In turns, players swap cards out for better cards from the center of the table. When a player is happy with their hand, they knock on the table and everyone else has one final turn. Everyone’s cards are revealed and scored. The next round starts.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ol>
<li>Deal four face-down cards in a square to each player</li>
<li>Place the rest of the deck in the middle of the table</li>
<li>Turn the first card from the middle over and place it next to the deck. This is the discard pile</li>
<li>Before the game starts each player can look at the two cards closest to them once</li>
</ol>
<h2>Keep in mind</h2>
<ul>
<li>The aim is to get the lowest score</li>
<li>Jacks are worth 0 points, Aces are worth 1 point, Kings and Queens are worth 10 points.</li>
<li>If you manage to line up cards of the same value in the same row or column, they cancel each other out and are worth 0 points</li>
</ul>
<h2>Play</h2>
<ol>
<li>The first player picks up the top card from either the deck or the discard pile</li>
<li>They decide whether they want to swap it for one of their four face-down cards</li>
<li>If they do not want it, they place the card in the discard pile</li>
<li>If they do, the card they swapped out goes on the discard pile</li>
<li>The next player takes their turn</li>
<li>Instead of picking up, a player can ‘knock’.</li>
<li>If someone knocks, everyone will get one final turn, and then the round is scored.</li>
<li>After 9 rounds, add up the scores from each round and declare a winner.</li>
</ol>
