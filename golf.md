## Kit
Deck of cards

## Players
2 to 7

## Objective
Get the lowest score possible with your four cards

## Summary
Golf has 9 rounds. Each player has a square of face-down cards. In turns, players swap cards out for better cards from the center of the table. When a player is happy with their hand, they knock on the table and everyone else has one final turn. Everyone’s cards are revealed and scored. The next round starts. 

## Setup
1. Deal four face-down cards in a square to each player
2. Place the rest of the deck in the middle of the table
3. Turn the first card from the middle over and place it next to the deck. This is the discard pile
4. Before the game starts each player can look at the two cards closest to them once 

## Keep in mind
* The aim is to get the lowest score
* Jacks are worth 0 points, Aces are worth 1 point, Kings and Queens are worth 10 points.
* If you manage to line up cards of the same value in the same row or column, they cancel each other out and are worth 0 points

## Play
1. The first player picks up the top card from either the deck or the discard pile
2. They decide whether they want to swap it for one of their four face-down cards
3. If they do not want it, they place the card in the discard pile
4. If they do, the card they swapped out goes on the discard pile
5. The next player takes their turn
6. Instead of picking up, a player can ‘knock’. 
7. If someone knocks, everyone will get one final turn, and then the round is scored.
8. After 9 rounds, add up the scores from each round and declare a winner.
